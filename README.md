# 12in23 Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various exercises I encountered during my learning journey in 2023 for the 12in23 challenge offered by Exercism website. The challenge offers 12 different languages to learn in 12 months, each month with a special theme.

## Themes and Languages

- **Intimate Introduction (January)**: For the month of January, I chose to use **C++** to solve the five exercises required. As I learned **C++** in university for my main courses and later used it for competitive programming to solve problems and learn advanced techniques. **C++** has been my go-to language for most projects because it allows me to solve problems quickly and efficiently. I continue to learn new things about **C++** every day and look forward to improving my skills in the future.
- **Functional February (February)**: For the month of February, I decided to tackle the theme of functional programming by learning and using **Elixir** to complete the five exercises required and the recommended functional exercises. I had never worked with a functional language before, but I found it fascinating how it encouraged a different way of thinking about programming.
- **Mechanical March (March)**: The theme for March is mechanical programming (languages which are compiled to machine code), and I chose to use **Go** to complete the exercises required for this theme. I had never worked with **Go** before, but I am exited to take this journey, solve various exercises, and learn more about the language.

## Repository Structure

Each month's exercises are organized in their respective directories in the root of the repository. The directory names follow a standard format of `<month number>- <month name>-language`, for instance, `01- jan-elixir` for January's exercises solved in Elixir. I made sure to keep the code clean and well-documented, so others can easily understand my thought process and approach to solving the problems.
