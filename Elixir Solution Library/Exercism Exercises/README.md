# Exercism Exercises  

While I practice Elixir on the great website **Exercism**, I always search for ways to improve my solutions such as:

1. **Asking** for mentoring, which is an amazing feature on **Exercism** that lets you contact with people that have more knowledge about the language who can help you go further in shorter time.
2. **Searching** for more materials that explains how something work in depth, or the best practices to do something.
3. **Reading** Elixir's documentation, as its documentation is really well written and detailed.

So, I wanted to share with the community my solutions with all these imporvements updated for anyone that wants to get benefit from it. 

**Please** contact me if you see that anything can be improved, or just wanted to add some note over my implementations for exercises.

**Each** exercise contains everything you may need for solving it including, description, hints, tests, and my solution (**YOU CAN FIND IT UNDER THE FOLDER "lib"**) 

**Enjoy Elixir!**
