# LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions

While I practice Elixir on the great website **Exercism**, I always search for ways to improve my solutions such as:

1. **Asking** for mentoring, which is an amazing feature on **Exercism** that lets you contact with people that have more knowledge about the language who can help you go further in shorter time.
2. **Searching** for more materials that explains how something work in depth, or the best practices to do something.
3. **Reading** Elixir's documentation, as its documentation is really well written and detailed.

One more thing that I used to improve my skills in Elixir is solving real and more-complex problems using it.  And as I solve  LeetCode Daily Challenge consistently every day, I started using Elixir to solve these questions.

I thought publishing my solutions can help other people who learn Elixir and want to hone their skills using the language.

**Please** contact me if you see that anything can be improved, or just wanted to add some note over my implementations for exercises.

**Enjoy Elixir!**
