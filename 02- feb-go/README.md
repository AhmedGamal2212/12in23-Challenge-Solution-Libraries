# Learning Go

This directory is created to document my solutions to various exercises, Leetcode daily challenge problems, and other related projects during my journey learning Go programming language.

## Exercism Solutions

In the `Exercism Exercises` directory, you can find my solutions to various Go exercises that I have come across during my learning journey. Each subdirectory contains the solution file(s) and a `README.md` file that explains the problem statement and the approach used to solve it. I have tried to keep the solutions simple and easy to understand, so that it can help others in their learning process.

## LeetCode Daily Challenges

In the `LeetCode Daily Challenge` directory, you can find my solutions to the Leetcode daily challenge problems. These challenges have been a great way to practice and improve my problem-solving skills in every programming language I learned.

## Other Projects

I will add a `projects` directory in case I want to publish any **Go** related projects, you can find other related projects that I have worked on during my journey learning Go programming language. These projects are not necessarily related to exercises or Leetcode challenges, but are still important milestones in my learning process. They include simple programs, web applications, and other interesting projects that I will work on.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with my solutions or have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I am always looking for ways to improve and learn from others.

## About Go

Go is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It was first released in 2009 and has since become increasingly popular due to its simplicity, speed, and ease of use. Some key features of Go include:

- Fast compilation times
- Garbage collection
- Built-in concurrency support
- Simple syntax and easy to learn
- Cross-platform compatibility

Go is particularly well-suited for building large-scale, distributed systems, such as web applications or network services. It is also commonly used for system programming, such as writing operating systems or device drivers.

In conclusion, Go is a powerful and efficient programming language that is well-suited for a wide range of applications. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for developers of all levels of experience.
